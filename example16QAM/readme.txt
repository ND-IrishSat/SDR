This is a project I did last year for the Communications Lab. It's kind of spaghetti code - most of it was adapted by and not written by me - but it can be used as a
reference for our project. The best way to get an idea of what's going on is to look at modemTest.py first and then all the other files. Don't bother with the .ipynb
files -- these are jupyter notebook files, so unless you have that set up you won't be able to open them.
